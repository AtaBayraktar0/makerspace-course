title: Getting started with 3D
---


## Introduction
 3D worlds await your touch. Blender, a powerful yet accessible 3D modeling software, empowers you to sculpt, animate, and bring your ideas to life. With intuitive tools and a supportive community, anyone can explore the boundless possibilities of 3D creation. Ready to unleash your inner artist?


## Learning objectives
 In this project, we will learn the basics of a 3D Modeling Program, “Blender”. We will dive into the unlimitedly possible things you can do in a digital playground. 

 ### Let’s warm up to this digital environment by asking  the following questions:
   - How can I define the environment I’m working with?
   - How will I shape the object as I want?
   - What do I need instead of a pencil to create things I imagine?
   - What makes my object so special or different?

 ### These will be our achievements from this tutorial:
   - Getting to know the most popular way for 3D modeling.
   - How to control the 3D coordinate systems.
   - 3D Transformations: Ways to shape and play with our objects.
   - Understand boolean operations: Interactions between objects.
